In this riddle, you are presented with the farmer's problem of transporting his animals and crops across a river. Here is the question:
 
A farmer needs to cross the river with his fox, his chicken and a bag of corn. However, the boat can only fit the farmer and one other thing at a time. The problem is, the fox and the chicken are both hungry, so if he leaves the fox and chicken together, the fox might eat the chicken. If he leaves the chicken and corn together, the chicken might eat the corn.
 
So how can the farmer get everyone across the river safely?
 
 
 
Ans:First, the farmer should take the chicken across.
 
Then, he can go back for the fox. When he arrives at the other side to drop off the fox, he can take the chicken back with him to get the corn.
 
The farmer drops off the chicken and transports the corn to the other side of the river.
 
Finally, the farmer goes back for the chicken and continues to the other side of the river with nothing eaten.
